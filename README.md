Timer applications.

WorkTimer:
A desktop timer application intended to be as simple as possible.
You can operate it both with your mouse and keyboard(only arrows and enter used).
It works, but I'm sorry, there are some non-referenced classes included,
since it's on the way of separating the UI and logic.
Hopefully the most basic factors for timer applications should be extracted
and something like a timer application framework formed.
